PLAYER / PARTY STUFF

When finished parsing party status, sort follower list by HP (lowest to highest).
Use this list during spellcasting to prioritize targets. Add spell option to restrict
spells to self or party (both by default). Add target spell option as well.

Should we make a second universal "party list" for both use as both leader and follower?
When "The following people ..." is parsed, clear the list. Then as players are parsed
add them to this list, sorted by health. Then use the party list for spellcasting
purposes.

How do we ensure list is complete?
IDEA -> record time par last read -- wait a short period before calling the
spellcasting routine



On startup load player.db, once in the realm parse who list and add those
not already in list. whenever the player.db is modified reread who list.
as people enter, add to the db. as they leave, mark as offline.

when you begin following someone set character.leader to their player record

when followers join add to character.followers, when parsing par command mark
followers as not present. when a follower is parsed, mark them as present. if
anyone is not present wait for them, after a period of time cut them loose.

when in a party, sort list of others by health. then call spellcasting for
each player until a spell is or is not selected. that way the person with the
lowest health will get the needed attention

when player is first seen, check if they are set to auto-invite. If they are,
and not already invited/joined then invite them. When the invitation message
is parsed, add the player to list of followers and set appropriate flags. in
client ai, when a player is invited request @join. when player begins following
you, update flags.

TODO ASAP

2) figure out why automapper cannot reorient self while following



a) when a player is seen, invite them.

b) once invited, add them to list of followers. set wait flag.

c) while invited but not joined, request player to join.

d) once joined, remove wait flag.


when message received, "you are not in party ..." reset all party data

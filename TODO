ASAP:

+ reloading character data file clears stored name, re-issue stat command?
+ need a better shortest path algorithm... the current model works great in
  some cases, poorly in others.
+ support finding/removing traps
+ support disease & held status ailments (parse patterns/actions needed)
- disable cursor while under mapped windows
- implement income rate stat
- support scripting "non-hostle" monsters correctly
- update followers when they disconnect

SOON:

- party support via DBUS w/ megamud style fallback system
- allow using specific strategies based on players present
- better communications handling (internal window or messenger plugin?)
+ implement full color scrollback using curses pads
- revamp monster data format and add more parameters such as elemental
  orientation and item dropping flag to trigger item checking
- support offensive spells such as vamp/dtch, possibly vuln

SOMEDAY:

- GUI tool to handle profile editing/management and advanced map editing
  functions.
- user definable UI colors
- user definable key bindings, for now there is a temporary handler in
  place to allow movement via the numeric keypad

# ITEM.DB
#
# This file contains the item parse patterns and corresponding actions.
# Many times, you will want to execute the same set of actions for different
# patterns. For this reason, it is possible to group patterns together to
# save space and (more importantly) effort :)
#
# TIP: while several tags have been defined to help simplify creating patterns,
# the underlying parsing system uses the powerful PCRE regexp engine. You can
# take advantage of this fact and use inline regexps anywhere within a pattern.

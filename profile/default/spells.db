# SPELLS.DB
#
# This file contains the spell control list. It is not necessary to define
# every spell your character possesses here. Only those that you would like
# to use currently. It is possible (and very useful) to have multiple
# definitions for the same spell. This will give you fine grained control
# over conditions for casting.
#
#  SAMPLE 1: This would cast mihe when your health falls below 90% and
#            your mana is above 40%. It will also permit combat to be
#            interrupted, if necessary.
#
#    Spell = mihe
#      HPThreshold = <90%
#      MAThreshold = >40%
#      SetFlag     = IntAttack
#      SetFlag     = Heal
#
#  SAMPLE 2: This defines a second set of rules for mihe. In this case, mihe
#            would be cast when your health is not at 100%, but your mana is.
#            It will also allow both resting and combat to be interrupted.
#
#    Spell = mihe
#      HPThreshold = not 100%
#      MAThreshold = is 100%
#      SetFlag     = IntAttack
#      SetFlag     = IntRest
#      SetFlag     = Heal
#
#  SAMPLE 3: This shows how to manage a time-based bless spell. It would
#            be cast whenever the spell becomes inactive and your mana is
#            above 60%. If the ending message isn't received within the
#            alloted time (in seconds) specified by MaxDuration, it will
#            be marked as inactive and recast.
#
#    Spell = bles
#      MAThreshold  = >60%
#      MaxDuration  = 600
#      MessageStart = "You cast bless on Khamsin!"
#      MessageEnd   = "The effects of bless wear off!"
#
# NOTE: you can omit the % sign while defining a threshold to use literal
# values instead of percentages. This is useful for mystics or characters
# with low amounts of mana.

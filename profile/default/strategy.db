# STRATEGY.DB
#
# This file contains the combat strategy control list. Basically, for
# each monster you face, one or more of these strategies will be used
# to control your actions in combat. The strategies used depends on the
# conditions present and the thresholds you have set for them.
#
# The selection process is very simple. It begins at the top of the list
# and works its way down. The first item that is within thresholds is
# executed and remains in effect until either the monster dies, or the
# strategy is no longer within the thresholds set for it. When this
# happens the selection process begins again and the next valid strategy
# in the list is activated. If for some reason none of the strategies
# are valid, MudPRO will always default to a normal WeaponAttack.
#
# Each strategy has several thresholds that can be configured. If any
# of them are omitted then a default value will be used. Please see the
# SAMPLE profile for a good example set of strategies.
#
# Available strategies:
#
# Backstab     = Engage with a backstab when successfully sneaking
# WeaponAttack = Your basic weapon attack (bashing optional)
# SpellAttack  = Use a combat spell (including room spells)
# Break        = Break off combat -- useful for power leveling
# Punch        = Mystic punch attack
# Jumpkick     = Mystic jumpkick attack
#

## TIP: if you set the Weapon parameter for a particular strategy, then that
## weapon will be used for its duration.

  Bash = FALSE

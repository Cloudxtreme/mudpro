# ITEM.DB

# This file contains the item control list. It is not necessary to have

# interact with. When an option is omitted, the default will be used.
#
# SAMPLE: This would pick up and carry one darkwood ring. It will also
#         automatically equip the ring as needed.
#
#   Item = "darkwood ring"
#     Equip   = Finger
#     Limit   = 1
#     SetFlag = AutoGet
#     SetFlag = AutoArm

## ITEMS ############################################################

## TIP: You can also set the value (in copper) of regular items such as
## fine broadswords so that they are included within your income rate

Item = "torch"
  SetFlag = Usable
  SetFlag = Light
  SetFlag = AutoGet
  Limit   = 3

Item = "lantern"
  SetFlag = Usable
  SetFlag = Light
  SetFlag = AutoGet
  Limit   = 3

Item = "black star key"
  SetFlag = AutoGet
  Limit   = 3

## EQUIPMENT ########################################################

## TIP: You can list the equipment in your inventory here and then set the
## AutoGet and AutoArm flags on each. That way, you will automatically recover
## your deathpile when returning to it. Be sure not to set AutoArm on two
## items using the same equipment slot though, for obvious reasons ;)
